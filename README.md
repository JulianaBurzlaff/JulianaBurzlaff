# Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juliana! I'm Graduated in Civil Engineering, but passionate about Front-End development and remote work. I'm a fast learner who loves to spend time studying new technologies. In addition to the logical thinking and strong problem-solving skills that come from my engineering background, I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJs, Redux, Cypress, and Git. ðŸš€<br>

I would love to learn and share with you ðŸ“š<br><br>
